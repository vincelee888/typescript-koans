# Typescript Koans

Inspired by @ChrisMarinos' [FSharpKoans](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans) (in turn, inspired by @EdgeCase's [RubyKoans](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans)), the goal of the Typescript koans is to learn Typescript through tests.

On starting the koans, you will be presented with a failing test, and a line number of the file that is failing. Your goal is to make that failing test pass. As you fix each failing test, you should learn something new about the language.

Your journey towards Typescript enlightenment starts in the 01_aboutVariables.test.ts file. These koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through more koans, more and more Typescript syntax will be introduced which will allow you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

## Pre-requisites

then install the dependencies:

```shell
npm i

```

### test an individual koan

```shell

```
